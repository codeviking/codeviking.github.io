      <h1>Seattle Hot Spots</h1>
      <h2>Sorry it took me so long to get you this darling, but here&rsquo;s a list
        of spots you sould check out with your daddio while he&rsquo;s in town!
      </h2>
      <div class=hotspot>
        <h2>Seattle Arboretum</h2>
        <p>The UW Aboretum / Botanical Gardens are amazing.  On a Sunny day take a walk through the massive
          gardens / marsh there to catch some spectacular plant and wild life.</p>
        <p><strong>Madison Park Beach</strong> is really close too, so you could head down there afterwards. There&rsquo;s also a few
          good places to eat down by the beach.</p>

      <div class=hotspot>
        <h2>Discovery Park</h2>
        <p>Discovery Park is breathtaking.  It&rsquo;s an old Military Base that was donated to the city.  Now it&rsquo;s a huge park
        with tons of beautiful scenery and hiking trails.  I&rsquo;d suggest checking out the beach.</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Discovery+Park/@47.661297,-122.417806,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x549015f0e18e409f:0x519842caa4fa6320" target=_blank>Google Map</a></p>

      <div class=hotspot>
        <h2>SAM Sculpture Park</h2>
        <p>The SAM sculpture park / Myrtle Edwards Park is a gorgeous park on the Seattle waterfront with an assortment
        of cool statues / art pieces.  It seems like something your dad would really dig.</p>
        <p>It&rsquo;s right downtown, so I&rsquo;d check it out after wandering out downtown for a bit.  Plus the sunset is beautiful from there.</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Olympic+Sculpture+Park/@47.616484,-122.355159,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x54901550271dcf73:0x7bfcfe1bfbd29f99" target=_blank>Google Map</a></p>

      <div class=hotspot>
        <h2>The Whale Wins + Gasworks Park</h2>
        <p>Gasworks park is an old oil refinery that made into a park.  Breathtaking views of the Seattle skyline and an intact old oil refinery make it a really cool park to check out.</p>
        <p>After checking out the park take your dad to the resturant "The Whale Wins."  It&rsquo;s got amazing food and is within walking distance of the park.</p>
        <p>P.S. I&rsquo;m definitely going to smooch you sometime at Gasworks park on a clear night when we&rsquo;ve got an impecable view of the city.</p>
