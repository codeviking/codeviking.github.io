              I was a senior individual contributor and technical leader on a team responsible for internal
              systems, infrastructure and broad-strokes engineering efforts impacting the entire research organization.
              I drove the design and development of a number of critical internal systems used broadly for AI research
              and helped launch a number of key applications, prototypes and demos that were pivotal to AI2's
              research efforts.
