          <li>
            <h4>Principal Software Engineer & Manager</h4>
            <em>January 2023 &#8212; Present</em>
            <p>
              I lead a team responsible for the internal systems and infrastructure used to run
              Ai2's machine learning research workloads. This includes <a href="https://blog.allenai.org/beaker-ed617d5f4593">Beaker</a>,
              a custom job orchestrator and experimentation platform, and the software required to
              configure and operate thousands of GPUs in an on-premise datacenter.
            <p>
            <p>Key accomplishments:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Shifted Beaker's NPS score from -13 to 36 in 1 year while also scaling up the number
                of workloads (3x) and compute footprint (7x).
              </li>
              <li>
                Drove organization-wide adoption; in 2021 less than 50% of research teams
                used Beaker, today 100% depend on it for critical workloads.
              </li>
              <li>
                Increased on-premise GPU occupancy from 47% to 95%+; reduced GPU downtime
                because of non-hardware issues to < 5%.
              </li>
              <li>
                Prioritized robustness and stability, reducing job failure rates by 40%, system failures
                to < 1% and achieving 99.996% uptime.
              </li>
              <li>
                Fostered a healthy, results-oriented culture while doubling the team size; responsible for
                managing 8 individual contributors.
              </li>

            <h4>Principal Software Engineer</h4>
            <em>January 2019 &#8212; January 2023</em>
            <p>
              I was a senior individual contributor and technical leader on a team responsible for internal
              infrastructure where I drove the design and development of a number of critical
              systems.
            </p>
            <p>Key accomplishments:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Assumed ownership of Beaker, led a build-vs-buy evaluation and established a roadmap
                for making the product a widely adopted, successful platform.
              </li>
              <li>
                Developed a new system for on-premise server configuration management that reduced
                downtime, improved stability, drove consistency and enabled safer, more frequent
                updates.
              </li>
              <li>
                Led the development and evolution of Skiff, a Kubernetes backed platform that standardized
                how people develop, build, deploy and operate web applications and APIs. Skiff remains
                the default solution despite minimal ongoing investment.
              </li>
              <li>
                Promoted to manager because of the team's broad impact and my successes as a technical leader.

            <p>
              I was a member of the platform group, responsible for building and operating shared systems and
              infrastructure. I led the development of an internal search application and consulted
              across several teams. My tenure was short as the role wasn't a good fit.
