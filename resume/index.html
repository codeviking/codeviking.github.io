            <p>
              I lead a team responsible for internal systems and infrastructure. Our primary focus
              is <a href="https://blog.allenai.org/beaker-ed617d5f4593">Beaker</a>, a custom job

            <ul>
              <li>
                Drove investments that led all teams to adopt Beaker; shifting the system's NPS
                from -13 to 36 in 1 year and increasing the number of executed jobs by 3x.
              </li>
              <li>
                Led the development of features that increased on-premise GPU occupancy to from 47% to 76%.

                Redesigned our on-premise server configuration management tooling, networking and
                host management practices. This improved GPU availability, enabled more frequent updates
                and drove consistency across our fleet.
              </li>
              <li>
                Assumed ownership of Beaker, AI2's custom job management system, and drove investments
                that improved reliability, increased adoption and renewed organizational confidence in
