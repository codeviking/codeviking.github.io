            <p>
              I lead a team responsible for internal systems and infrastructure. Our principal focus
              is <a href="https://blog.allenai.org/beaker-ed617d5f4593">Beaker</a>, a custom job
              management system used for running AI workloads on on-premise GPU servers. My team
              is also responsible for the configuration management of those servers, an inference
              platform and a common solution for deploying and serving web applications.

                Drove investments that <strong>led all research teams to adopt Beaker</strong>, <strong>shifted
                the system's NPS from -13 to 36 in 1 year</strong>, and <strong>increased the number of jobs executed
                by 334%</strong>

                and <strong>99.996% uptime</strong>
              </li>
              <li>
                Fostered a healthy, results-oriented culture while doubling the team size, <strong>
                enabling the organization to double it's on-premise GPU footprint</strong>

              I was a senior individual contributor and technical leader on a team responsible for internal
              systems and infrastructure used by the entire research organization. I drove the design and
              development of a number of critical internal systems and helped launch a number of key applications,
